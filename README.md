# KozakScript

test.kozak is used to test the feautures, please no need to modify it, you can make your own file

To run, you need to have python installed.

Step 1:

Install python from the official website

Step 2:

Open the folder "KozakScript" in the code editor (I was testing on VS Code)

Step 3:

Open Terminal, and type: py main.py [path to the .kozak file] (make sure, you have the extension .kozak at the end of the desired file, otherwise it won't work)
