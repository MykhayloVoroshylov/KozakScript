I am a coding enthusiast who decided to make my own programming language prototype. As a Ukrainian, I found it a fun idea, to make a language that reflects my culture, and can be used later, if needed, by professional programmers, or as a way for Ukrainian-speaking people to have an opportunity, which I personally never had: to learn programming with terms and words they are more familiar with, which is why I didn't stop on single HelloWorld program syntax, but went further to make the language actually functional.

The syntax is mostly similar to C++ and Python with a touch of Pascal. However it has its own unique features, such as the usage of Ukrainian terms for methods, such as 'Spivaty' (sing) for printing, or 'Slukhai' (listen) for input. You can view the syntax examples in test.kozak file, or wait a bit: once I finish version 1.0, I will provide a .txt file with all the syntax rules, and possibly the YouTube videos explaining it. Additionally, you may find examples of programs in the "Examples" folder.

This is not a complete version yet ‚Äî I am still improving it, adding new features, and fixing bugs. Most things are already functional and ready to use, so you can start having fun with it! :)

The "test.kozak" file is used to test the features. Please don't modify it; you can create your own files for experimentation (or profesional development, if you wish to do so :) ).
