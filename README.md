# KozakScript

I am a coder enthusiast, who decided to make my own programming language prototype. As a Ukrainian, I found it a very fun idea, to make a language that reflects my culture, and can be used later, if needed, by real programmers, which is why I didn't stop on single HelloWorld program syntax, but went further to make the language actually functional.

The syntax is very similar to the one of C++, Python, and a little: Pascal, however it has its own unique features, such as the usage of ukrainian terms for methods, such as Spivaty (sing) for print, or Slukhai (listen) for input. You can view the syntax examples in test.kozak file, or wait a bit, and as soon as I finish the 1.0 version, I will make a .txt file with all the syntax rules, and perhaps the YouTube videos explaining it.

It is not a complete version yet, I am still improving it, and adding new features, as well as fixing bugs, but most things are already done, and ready to use, so you can already have fun with it :)

test.kozak is used to test the features, please no need to modify it, you can make your own file

To run, you need to have python installed.

Step 1:

Install python from the official website

Step 2:

Open the folder "KozakScript" in the code editor (I was testing on VS Code)

Step 3:

Open Terminal, and type: py main.py [path to the .kozak file] (make sure, you have the extension .kozak at the end of the desired file, otherwise it won't work)
