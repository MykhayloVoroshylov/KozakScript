# KozakScript

I am a coder enthusiast, who decided to make my own programming language prototype. As a ukrainian, I found it a very fun idea, to make a language that reflects my culture, and can be used later, if needed, by real programmers, which is why I didn't stop on single HelloWorld program syntax, but went further to make the language actually functional.

The syntax is very similar to the one of C++, Python, and a little: Pascal, however it has it's own unique features, such as the usage of ukrainian terms for methods, such as Spivaty (sing) for print, or Slukhai (listen) for input.

It is not a complete version yet, I am still improving it, and adding new features, as well as fixing bugs, but most things are already done, and ready to use, so you can already have fun with it :)

test.kozak is used to test the feautures, please no need to modify it, you can make your own file

To run, you need to have python installed.

Step 1:

Install python from the official website

Step 2:

Open the folder "KozakScript" in the code editor (I was testing on VS Code)

Step 3:

Open Terminal, and type: py main.py [path to the .kozak file] (make sure, you have the extension .kozak at the end of the desired file, otherwise it won't work)
